# Local Food Wastage Management System

This repository contains the complete project code and resources for the **Local Food Wastage Management System**, a comprehensive solution aimed at reducing food waste and alleviating food insecurity through technology-enabled redistribution.

## Project Overview

Food wastage is a major global and local challenge, affecting economies, the environment, and social welfare. Every day, a huge amount of edible food is discarded by households, restaurants, and grocery stores, while many individuals face food insecurity.

The core issue is inefficient redistribution of surplus foodâ€”food that could benefit others goes to waste. This project develops a platform that connects food providers (restaurants, grocery stores, individuals) with people and organizations in need, ensuring surplus food finds new purpose.

## Key Features

- **Data Management:** Uses a MySQL database to store detailed information about providers, receivers, food listings, and claims.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit, allowing:
  - Filtering food donations by location, provider, and food type.
  - Real-time CRUD operations to add, update, or remove data.
  - Execution of 15 insightful SQL queries for analytics.
- **Contact Access:** Displays contact details of providers and receivers to facilitate coordination.
- **Analytics:** Enables data-driven insights on food wastage trends, donation volumes, and demand hotspots.

## Dataset Description

- **Providers:** Contains donors like restaurants, grocery stores, supermarkets (ID, name, type, address, city, contact).
- **Receivers:** Contains recipients such as NGOs, community centers, individuals (ID, name, type, city, contact).
- **Food Listings:** Records available food items with details like quantity, expiry, location, type.
- **Claims:** Tracks who claimed which food item, its status, and timestamps.
